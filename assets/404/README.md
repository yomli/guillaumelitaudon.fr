A good 404 is a funny one. A very good lets you play a game.

## The 404 Game

It's just a basic rogue-like in javascript. It uses the [roguelike-skeleton](https://unstoppablecarl.github.io/js-roguelike-skeleton/manual/) framework and [rot.js](https://ondras.github.io/rot.js/hp/) is included but is useless here.
