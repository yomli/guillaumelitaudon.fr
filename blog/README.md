This is a [PluXML](http://www.pluxml.org/) theme and a selection of plugins I use with.

## Usage

Just replace the original `themes` and `plugins` folders with this ones.

### Code

You can use the syntax highlighter by activating the plugin called *spxshortcodes*.
Simply wrap the code with the markup `[code class="language"][/code]` and it will be
replaced by `<pre><code class="language"></code></pre>` with escaped HTML entities.

With no `language` attribute, the syntax highlighter will try to detect it automaticaly.
